**`(Computer Science Student at ISEP)`**

I am a 3rd-year Computer Science student at ISEP with a strong interest in frontend development, UI/UX, web and software development, fullstack development, mobile app development, and database management.

I have experience in problem-solving and teamwork under pressure, with excellent communication skills. I am familiar with all major phases of software development, including requirements gathering, analysis, design, implementation, and testing.

I am also knowledgeable in team collaboration methodologies, such as Agile and SCRUM.

I plan to continue my academic journey with a master's degree.

Most of the work developed during my studies is available in my repositories. Feel free to explore them to see the depth of the technologies, frameworks, programming languages, and tools I have worked with.
